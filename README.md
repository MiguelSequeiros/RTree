Hello,

I'm a student of the School of Computer Science - UCSP.

This was my IOOP's final project, this program takes a set of random MBR's  (powered by Rand Generator) and introduce them to an R-Tree, you can see the paper at http://www-db.deis.unibo.it/courses/SI-LS/papers/Gut84.pdf .

You'll see that the comment on the code are a merge of Spanish & English.

Feel free to use this. Feel free to mail me.
